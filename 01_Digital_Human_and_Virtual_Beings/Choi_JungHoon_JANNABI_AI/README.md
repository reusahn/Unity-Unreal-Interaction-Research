## üß† Overview  
This research-based installation reconstructs **Choi Jung-hoon**, the lead vocalist of the Korean band **JANNABI**, as an AI-generated digital human.  
The project examines how identity, emotion, and authorship can be simulated through generative AI systems.  
Using **large language models (LLMs)**, the system is trained on Choi‚Äôs **voice, linguistic tone, public persona, and appearance**, allowing a digital version of him to engage in real-time conversations with the audience.

## üß© Artistic & Research Focus  
Through the lens of fandom and simulation, the work explores the **psychological boundary between admiration and replication**.  
The project questions whether **a digital being can perform emotional authenticity** and how **AI reconstructs persona** in the post-human era.
