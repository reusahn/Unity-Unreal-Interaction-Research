## 🧩 Overview  
**Seon-a’s Family** is a media art project that reconstructs a broken family relationship through **AI-generated faces, digital humans, and emotional voice synthesis**.  
The work imagines a fictional family — mother, daughter, and sister — created entirely from the artist’s own facial and vocal data.  
Through this reconstruction, the project explores themes of **grief, reconciliation, and emotional inheritance**, turning digital creation into a process of healing.  

The story unfolds in a **virtual funeral setting**, where the artist interacts with his AI-generated family, confronting unresolved emotions between life and death.  
It becomes both a **personal ritual** and an **experiment in human–AI empathy**, merging cinematic storytelling with computational creation.

## ⚙️ Technical Description  
- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5 · Unity  
- **Software:** MetaHuman Creator · Maya · Blender  
- **Language:** Python · C#  
- **AI Models:** Stable Diffusion · ElevenLabs (voice cloning) · LLM-based dialogue  
- **Hardware:** PC (NVIDIA RTX 4090), Display Screen, Audio System  
- **Pipeline:**  
  1. **Face Generation:**  
     The artist’s own facial features were used to generate AI-synthesized faces for the mother and sister using **diffusion models**.  
     These generated faces were imported into **MetaHuman Creator**, reconstructing lifelike 3D digital humans.  
  2. **Voice Cloning:**  
     Using **ElevenLabs**, the artist’s voice was cloned and pitch-shifted into female tones to represent the voices of the mother and sister.  
     Each model retained emotional variation in tone, creating subtle differences in personality and sentiment.  
  3. **Animation & Narrative:**  
     Based on a personal story written by the artist, all dialogue and motion were scripted and animated inside **Unreal Engine** and **Unity’s Timeline System**.  
     The virtual environment—a symbolic funeral—was designed to represent emotional closure in a shared digital afterlife.  
  4. **Installation Setup:**  
     The final video and real-time interactive elements were projected across two exhibition spaces:  
     **KOTE Gallery (Insadong)** and **Wolseong Yakbang**, as part of a media art program exploring digital memory.

## 🧠 Artistic & Research Focus  
**Seon-a’s Family** examines how **AI can mediate emotional reconciliation** through simulation and self-reflection.  
By transforming the artist’s identity into three interrelated digital personas, the work blurs boundaries between **creator and subject**, **memory and fabrication**.  
It asks whether emotional truth can emerge from synthetic representation — and whether digital resurrection can heal what remains unspoken.
