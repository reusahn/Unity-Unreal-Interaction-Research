## 🧩 Overview  
**Yaloo_Collaboration** is a two-part research-based media art project created in collaboration with artist **Yaloo**, exploring posthuman identity, memory, and digital resurrection.  
The work examines how digital humans can transcend biological boundaries through immersive technologies and algorithmic imagination.  

The first part, **Posthuman Seaweed Being**, reimagines Yaloo as a hybrid creature merging human and marine life.  
The being carries Yaloo’s facial features while shifting fluidly between the forms of a **child, adult, and elder**, representing cyclical transformation and posthuman evolution.  

The second part, **VR Grandmother Reconstruction**, reconstructs Yaloo’s late grandmother as a **volumetrically scanned digital human**, rigged and animated through AI-driven motion systems within a virtual environment.  
This piece reflects on intergenerational connection and the preservation of familial presence through technology.

## 🧠 Artistic & Research Focus  
The collaboration explores **posthuman embodiment**, **digital mortality**, and **technological reincarnation**.  
Through the convergence of human memory and computational form, the project questions how technology redefines emotional continuity and biological transformation.  
It presents **the body as both archive and organism**, existing between nature and simulation.
