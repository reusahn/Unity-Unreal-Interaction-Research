## 🧩 Overview  
**Yaloo_Collaboration** is a posthuman media art project created in collaboration with artist **Yaloo**, exploring identity, transformation, and digital ecology.  
The work reimagines Yaloo as a **hybrid being merging human and seaweed**, a symbolic organism that embodies posthuman evolution and ecological interconnectedness.  

The creature possesses Yaloo’s facial features while fluidly transforming between the appearances of a **child, adult, and elder**, reflecting cyclical time and the continuous regeneration of life.  
Through this mutable existence, the project visualizes the merging of organic and digital bodies, suggesting a future where humanity and nature coexist through technological synthesis.

## 🧠 Artistic & Research Focus  
This collaboration investigates **posthuman identity**, **digital organismal evolution**, and **ecological embodiment**.  
By merging human facial recognition with organic marine textures, the project explores how **technology can express symbiosis rather than domination**.  
It positions the **posthuman body** as a site of empathy and transformation—an interface between nature, machine, and memory.
