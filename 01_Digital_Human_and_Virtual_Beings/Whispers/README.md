## 🧩 Overview  
**Mysomania** is a 3D short film exploring **guilt, survival, and moral decay** through psychological metaphor.  
Three strangers awaken on a drifting raft, with no memory of how they arrived.  
As they share mysterious meat to survive, silence begins to unravel their deepest guilt—  
and those who attempt to justify their past actions gradually disappear, one by one.  

The film employs **minimal dialogue, symbolic imagery, and surreal atmosphere** to examine the boundary between human instinct and ethical collapse.
