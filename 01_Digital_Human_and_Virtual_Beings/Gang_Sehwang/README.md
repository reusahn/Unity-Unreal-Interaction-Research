## üß† Overview
Gang Se-hwang AI Docent is an interactive media installation that digitally revives **Gang Se-hwang**‚Äîrenowned painter and mentor to **Kim Hong-do**‚Äîas an AI human.  
Recreated through real-time interaction, Gang Se-hwang serves as a **docent at the Gyeonggi Provincial Museum**, guiding visitors through historical narratives and offering photo-taking experiences.  
The installation reimagines cultural memory through artificial intelligence, allowing audiences to meet and interact with a **digitally embodied scholar of the Joseon Dynasty** in a hybrid time-space.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Description
The digital reconstruction was achieved through a multi-stage pipeline combining traditional 3D artistry, motion capture, and real-time systems:

1. **Source Material Collection:**  
   Archival portraits were provided by the **Gyeonggi Provincial Museum**, forming the basis for Gang Se-hwang‚Äôs visual reference.  
2. **Voice and Performance Casting:**  
   An actor with a **similar vocal tone and physical presence** was cast, and a **professional performer** was hired to embody the scholar‚Äôs gestures.  
3. **Character Creation:**  
   Using **ZBrush**, the likeness of Gang Se-hwang was digitally sculpted, then **rigged and textured** to achieve lifelike realism.  
4. **Motion Capture:**  
   - **Body motion** was recorded using the **OptiTrack system**.  
   - **Facial motion** was captured through **Apple ARKit**, synchronizing expression and speech.  
5. **Costume Simulation:**  
   Traditional Korean attire (hanbok, gat hat, and robes) was modeled and simulated in **Blender** and **Maya**.  
6. **Integration in Unity:**  
   All assets were imported into **Unity 3D**, where interactive animation triggers (buttons and audience interactions) were implemented.  
7. **Installation Deployment:**  
   The final interactive AI docent was deployed at the **Gyeonggi Provincial Museum**, operating in real time as a responsive digital guide.
