## 🧩 Overview  
**Scott Collaboration** is an interactive media installation developed in collaboration with **Scott**,  
who worked with the photograph of his late mother and a close friend to explore **memory, loss, and digital reanimation**.  
The project transforms personal photographs into **3D sculptural forms resembling marble or plaster statues**,  
which are then animated using **generative AI video synthesis** to evoke fragments of living memory.  

Each sculptural figure displays AI-generated video projections that are spatially arranged according to **luminance depth values**,  
creating a dynamic perception of volume and emotional presence.  
When a viewer’s face is detected via webcam, the corresponding AI memory video activates—  
allowing a moment of recognition between the living and the digital echoes of the past.

## ⚙️ Technical Description  
- **Engine:** Unity  
- **Software:** Maya · Blender · OpenCV  
- **Language:** C# · Python  
- **AI Tools:** Generative Video Synthesis (diffusion-based)  
- **Hardware:** PC (NVIDIA RTX 4090), Webcam, Projection System  
- **Pipeline:**  
  1. 2D photographs of Scott’s late mother and friend processed into 3D marble-like sculptures  
  2. Diffusion-based AI model generates video portraits from the reconstructed images  
  3. Real-time luminance mapping creates depth and dynamic light across each sculpture  
  4. OpenCV-based facial recognition triggers AI videos on specific statues  
  5. Unity system synchronizes motion, projection, and ambient light for immersive response

## 🧠 Artistic & Research Focus  
The collaboration explores **the intersection of grief, memory, and artificial resurrection**.  
It transforms photographic remembrance into a **living digital space** that responds to human presence.  
Through generative AI and computer vision, the project questions how technology mediates intimacy,  
and whether memory preserved through algorithms can still carry emotional truth.
