## 🧩 Overview  
**Shin Inho** is a digital human reconstruction project that revives **Yaloo’s late grandmother** through **volumetric 3D scanning and AI-driven animation**.  
Captured with full-body volumetric imaging, her presence was restructured through digital rigging, facial expression synthesis, and real-time rendering.  

The project seeks to **preserve emotional memory through technology**, merging affection, grief, and computation into a single living archive.  
The reconstructed grandmother’s subtle gestures—breathing, blinking, head tilts—were generated algorithmically, giving presence to a person no longer physically here.

## ⚙️ Technical Description  
- **Engine:** Unity · Unreal Engine 5  
- **Software:** Maya · Blender · Faceit Plugin · Photoshop  
- **Language:** C# · Python  
- **Hardware:** PC (NVIDIA RTX 4070 Super) · Volumetric 3D Scanner (Full-body capture rig)  
- **Pipeline:**  
  1. **Volumetric Capture:**  
     A full-body 3D scan was conducted in a professional volumetric studio, producing a **4K texture-mapped mesh** of the grandmother’s figure.  
  2. **Auto-Rigging & Facial Setup:**  
     The model was automatically rigged using a custom skeleton generator.  
     Facial controls were implemented with the **Faceit plugin** inside *Maya*, generating **64 blendshapes** compatible with **Apple ARKit Live Link** for facial animation.  
  3. **Material & Texture Refinement:**  
     Textures were enhanced and cleaned in **Photoshop** and **Substance Painter**, ensuring skin tone consistency and realism.  
     Shaders in Unity were customized for **subsurface scattering** and **organic translucency** to retain a lifelike quality.  
  4. **Hair Simulation:**  
     Real-time hair dynamics were built using Unity’s **Hair Solution**, allowing subtle natural motion synchronized with the body rig.  
  5. **Accessory Integration:**  
     Small personal items such as **dental ornaments and jewelry** were modeled and parented precisely to the rig hierarchy, preserving deformation integrity during animation.  
  6. **Real-Time Rendering:**  
     The final digital human was rendered interactively in Unity and Unreal, enabling **real-time playback of emotional gestures** derived from the AI motion model.

## 🧠 Artistic & Research Focus  
**Shin Inho** explores the boundary between **technological preservation and emotional authenticity**,  
asking whether **data can remember affection** or **simulate presence without imitation**.  
Through the meticulous reconstruction of a loved one, the project proposes **digital resurrection not as duplication, but as continuity**—  
a coexistence between loss, memory, and machine empathy.
