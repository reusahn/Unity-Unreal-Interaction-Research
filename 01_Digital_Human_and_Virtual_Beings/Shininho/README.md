## 🧩 Overview  
**Shin Inho** is a digital human reconstruction project that revives **Yaloo’s late grandmother** through volumetric capture and AI-driven animation.  
Using **3D scanning, high-resolution texturing, and procedural motion synthesis**, the project transfers a human presence into digital form—  
exploring the boundary between technological preservation and emotional memory.  

The reconstructed grandmother moves and emotes through subtle gestures generated by artificial intelligence.  
She exists both as **a dataset and a human presence**, evoking a quiet moment of reunion that merges affection, remembrance, and computation.

## 🧠 Artistic & Research Focus  
This work investigates **digital resurrection and emotional authenticity** in the context of human–machine preservation.  
By transforming an intimate familial presence into a digital human, **Shin Inho** explores how technology can embody memory without replacing it.  
The project asks whether **data can remember love**—and what remains of humanity when affection becomes algorithmic.
