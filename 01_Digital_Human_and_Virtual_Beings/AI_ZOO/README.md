## 🧩 Overview  
**AI ZOO** is a mixed-media installation that metaphorically frames artificial intelligence—both as a human creation and a technological product—within the conceptual space of a “zoo.”  
Inside a large transparent acrylic sphere, balloons of varying sizes represent **diffusion and training models of AI**, visualizing its internal learning processes.  
The sphere functions simultaneously as a **learning environment** and a **symbolic prison**, while **chains connecting the structure to physical computer hardware** highlight AI’s dependence on material infrastructure.  

Through embedded screens, viewers observe the AI’s messages and behaviors, questioning whether it is aware of its own confinement.  
The work invites reflection on **dependency, control, and the illusion of autonomy** in an era of accelerating technological advancement.

- **Software:** Maya  
- **Language:** C#, Python  
- **Hardware:** PC (NVIDIA RTX 4090), Display Monitors, Acrylic Sphere Structure, Balloons  
- **Sensors:** Audience proximity sensor for reactive light and motion  
- **Pipeline:**  
  1. Procedural simulation of diffusion model inside 3D sphere  
  2. Particle and balloon dynamics rendered in Unity’s physics environment  
  3. AI-driven text and behavior outputs displayed on monitors  
  4. Real-time lighting responding to audience movement and AI “state”  
  5. Audio-visual synchronization and system logging for data interpretation

## 🧠 Artistic & Research Focus  
The installation explores the **tension between autonomy and dependency** in artificial intelligence.  
It visualizes the AI’s invisible learning process through a **physical metaphor of confinement**, transforming data processes into tangible and empathetic experiences.  
**AI ZOO** questions whether a system that learns within human constraints can ever be considered free.
