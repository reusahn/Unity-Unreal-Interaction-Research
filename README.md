# Unity–Unreal Interfacing Research  
by **Jonghoon Ahn**

A collection of experimental projects developed in real-time game engine environments using Unity and Unreal Engine.  
The works explore how artistic visual styles can be recreated and implemented within real-time systems, extending into XR research through VR and AR technologies.  
They also include the creation of digital humans through 3D scanning, Gaussian splatting, and generative image or video synthesis.  

Each project combines artistic inquiry with technical experimentation to expand motion, emotion, and data into new forms of interactive experience.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 01. Digital Human & Virtual Beings  
A research-driven exploration tracing how digital beings evolve from historical reconstruction to emotional simulation and shared authorship.  
It began with reviving the 18th-century painter **Gang Sehwang** through motion capture and voice performance,  
then expanded into **Choi JungHoon (JANNABI AI)**, where an LLM embodied a musician’s personality — turning fandom into a study of digital empathy.  

As the line between human and synthetic emotion blurred, **AI ZOO** reflected on the ethics of confinement and empathy toward artificial life.  
From there, **Seon A’s Family** sought reconciliation through virtual presence, and **Whispers** explored fear and consciousness in AI-generated cinema.  
Finally, collaborations with **Yaloo** and **Scott** extended empathy into shared creation — transforming digital humanity into a collective experience.  

**Keywords:** Unreal Engine · MetaHuman · Motion Capture · AI Simulation  

**Projects:**  
- **Gang Sehwang** — Classical Korean painter reimagined as a digital human; reinterpretation of Joseon-era aesthetics through 3D embodiment.  
- **Choi JungHoon (JANNABI AI)** — LLM-based digital reconstruction of a musician, exploring parasocial intimacy and emotional simulation.  
- **AI ZOO** — Interactive installation questioning the ethics of empathy toward synthetic beings.  
- **Seon A’s Family** — Virtual family portrait bridging memory, ancestry, and emotional reconciliation.  
- **Whispers** — Poetic AI-driven short exploring silence, loss, and fear as reflections of machine consciousness.  
- **Yaloo Collaboration** — Shared virtual performance merging generational memory and posthuman identity.  
- **Scott Collaboration** — Multi-avatar experiment exploring digital community and generative gesture.

### 🎨 02. AR-based Style Transfer  
Merges physical and digital aesthetics using AR, real-time rendering, and neural style transfer techniques.  
Includes experiments that reconstruct the unique visual styles of other artists — from Picasso to Joseon-era comics to contemporary painter Erin — implemented as real-time generative filters within Unity.  

**Keywords:** Unity AR Foundation · Neural Style Transfer · Real-time Texture Mapping  

**Projects:**  
- **Picasso** — AR experiment applying classical painting styles to live camera feeds.  
- **Jemulpo Photo Studio** — AR portrait experience inspired by historical photography and cultural hybridity.  
- **Erin** — AR installation visualizing emotion through stylized filters and gesture-based feedback.  
- **Beads Wall** — Large-scale interactive wall using Azure Kinect motion data to drive particle-based visualization.

### 🕺 03. Sensor-based Interaction (Azure Kinect)  
Investigates how sensor-based perception bridges the physical and digital space through motion data, body tracking, and spatial choreography.  

**Keywords:** Azure Kinect · OpenCV · Depth Sensing · Motion Visualization  

**Projects:**  
- **Silhak Dance** — Interactive performance using body movement as data to generate visual compositions.  
- **To Eternity** — Depth-based choreography exploring continuity between motion, space, and time.

### 🥽 04. Interactive VR Experience  
Immersive prototypes exploring narrative, emotion, and agency in virtual environments.  

**Keywords:** Unity XR Toolkit · Unreal Engine · OpenXR · Presence & Agency  

**Projects:**  
- **Escape Metro** — A surreal VR escape experience set in an uncanny subway system.  
  Players must solve puzzles and engage in real-time conversations with an in-game AI (powered by ChatGPT) to uncover the hidden logic of their entrapment.  
  The piece examines isolation, digital consciousness, and the boundaries between algorithmic and human reasoning.  

- **Graffiti Freedom** — A participatory VR experience where users reclaim digital public space through gesture-driven graffiti.  
  By painting freely within a simulated subway station, participants experience liberation within constraint, transforming acts of rebellion into digital expression.  

- **Narci, Be Narci** — An interactive VR simulation exploring narcissism and self-reflection.  
  The viewer is placed in control of elegant, moving human-like figures, transforming them into statues or piles of metal through will alone.  
  The project visualizes how control and ego can erode empathy and self-worth.  

- **Fineo, Translated Universe** — A poetic VR visualization reconstructing the periodic table as a harmonic system of movement and sound.  
  Elemental data is mapped through harmonograph-inspired functions, generating a new system of visual logic.  
  The work received the Grand Prize at the 16th Kookmin University Art & Design Exhibition, recognizing its synthesis of scientific structure and aesthetic abstraction.
