# 🎮 Unity–Unreal Interfacing Research  
by **Jonghoon Ahn**

A curated collection of research-based projects and prototypes exploring  
**human–machine interfacing, immersive visualization, and digital embodiment**  
through Unity and Unreal Engine.

Each work merges artistic inquiry with technical experimentation,  
bridging **motion, emotion, and data** into new forms of interactive expression.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
**Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine 5  
**Languages:** C#, C++, Python  
**SDKs:** OpenXR, AR Foundation, Azure Kinect SDK, OpenCV, Barracuda  
**Hardware:** Azure Kinect, Meta Quest 3, OptiTrack, Leap Motion  
**Other Tools:** Maya, Blender, VFX Graph, Git

## 🧑‍💻 Research Focus  
This collection bridges art and engineering, using game engines as platforms for experimentation in  
**human–machine interfacing, immersive visualization, and digital empathy.**  
It demonstrates how real-time tools can serve both creative and scientific inquiry,  
revealing how humans and machines exchange perception, emotion, and agency within real-time systems.

## 🧍‍♂️ 01. [Digital Human & Virtual Beings](./01_Digital_Human_and_Virtual_Beings/README.md)  
Explores empathy, embodiment, and the perception of artificial life through motion capture, MetaHuman, and AI-driven characters.  
**Keywords:** Unreal Engine · MetaHuman · Motion Capture · AI Simulation  

### Conceptual Flow  
The series began by reviving a historical figure (*Gang Sehwang*) through digital human reconstruction.  
From there, Ahn created *JANNABI AI* to explore parasocial connection and language modeling, leading to *AI ZOO*,  
an installation that questions empathy toward synthetic beings.  
Personal narratives such as *Seon A’s Family* and *Whispers* then humanize digital entities,  
while later collaborations (*Yaloo* and *Scott*) extend this inquiry into collective and relational virtual embodiment.

## 🎨 02. [AR-based Style Transfer](./02_AR_Style_Transfer/README.md)  
Merges physical and digital aesthetics using AR, real-time rendering, and neural style transfer techniques.  
This section also includes projects that replicate the **visual language of other artists**—from classical painters like Picasso and Joseon-era cartoonists to Erin’s own stylized brushwork—translated into real-time Unity rendering systems.  
**Keywords:** Unity AR Foundation · Neural Style Transfer · Real-time Texture Mapping
