# 🎮 Unity–Unreal Interfacing Research  
by **Jonghoon Ahn**

A curated collection of research-based projects and prototypes exploring  
**human–machine interfacing, immersive visualization, and digital embodiment**  
through Unity and Unreal Engine.

Each work merges artistic inquiry with technical experimentation,  
bridging **motion, emotion, and data** into new forms of interactive expression.

## 🧑‍💻 Research Focus  
This collection bridges art and engineering, using game engines as platforms for experimentation in  
**human–machine interfacing, immersive visualization, and digital empathy.**  
It demonstrates how real-time tools can serve both creative and scientific inquiry,  
revealing how humans and machines exchange perception, emotion, and agency within real-time systems.
