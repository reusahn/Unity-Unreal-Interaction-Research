# 🎮 Unity–Unreal Interfacing Research  
by **Jonghoon Ahn**

A curated collection of research-based projects and prototypes exploring  
**human–machine interfacing, immersive visualization, and digital embodiment**  
through Unity and Unreal Engine.

Each work merges artistic inquiry with technical experimentation,  
bridging **motion, emotion, and data** into new forms of interactive expression.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
**Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine 5  
**Languages:** C#, C++, Python  
**SDKs:** OpenXR, AR Foundation, Azure Kinect SDK, OpenCV, Barracuda  
**Hardware:** Azure Kinect, Meta Quest 3, OptiTrack, Leap Motion  
**Other Tools:** Maya, Blender, VFX Graph, Git

## 🧑‍💻 Research Focus  
This collection bridges art and engineering, using game engines as platforms for experimentation in  
**human–machine interfacing, immersive visualization, and digital empathy.**  
It demonstrates how real-time tools can serve both creative and scientific inquiry,  
revealing how humans and machines exchange perception, emotion, and agency within real-time systems.

## 🧍‍♂️ 01. Digital Human & Virtual Beings  
Explores empathy, embodiment, and the perception of artificial life through motion capture, MetaHuman, and AI-driven characters.  
**Keywords:** Unreal Engine · MetaHuman · Motion Capture · AI Simulation  

### Conceptual Flow  
The series began by reviving a historical figure (*Gang Sehwang*) through digital human reconstruction.  
From there, Ahn created *JANNABI AI* to explore parasocial connection and language modeling, leading to *AI ZOO*,  
an installation that questions empathy toward synthetic beings.  
Personal narratives such as *Seon A’s Family* and *Whispers* then humanize digital entities,  
while later collaborations (*Yaloo* and *Scott*) extend this inquiry into collective and relational virtual embodiment.

### Projects
- **강세황 (Gang Sehwang)** — Classical Korean painter reimagined as a digital human; reinterpretation of Joseon-era aesthetics through 3D embodiment.  
- **최정훈 (Choi JungHoon)** — Data-based self-simulation exploring fragmented identity and machine perception.  
- **AI ZOO** — Interactive installation about AI confinement and empathy toward synthetic beings.  
- **선아의 가족 (Seon A’s Family)** — Virtual family portrait bridging memory, ancestry, and digital embodiment.  
- **Whispers** — Poetic digital short exploring silence, loss, and emotional reconstruction.  
- **Yaloo Collaboration** — Shared virtual performance merging live motion and digital avatars.  
- **신인호 (Shin Inho)** — MetaHuman study exploring digital realism and body simulation.  
- **Scott Collaboration** — Multi-avatar experiment with generative gestures and collective behavior.

## 🎨 02. AR-based Style Transfer  
Merges physical and digital aesthetics using AR, real-time rendering, and neural style transfer techniques.  
This section also includes projects that replicate the **visual language of other artists**—from classical painters like Picasso and Joseon-era cartoonists to Erin’s own stylized brushwork—translated into real-time Unity rendering systems.  
**Keywords:** Unity AR Foundation · Neural Style Transfer · Real-time Texture Mapping  

### Projects  
- **피카소 (Picasso)** — AR experiment applying classical painting styles to live camera feeds.  
- **제물포 사진관 (Jemulpo Photo Studio)** — AR portrait experience inspired by historical photography and cultural hybridity.  
- **Erin Collaboration** — AR installation recreating Erin’s painterly visual language within Unity through dynamic brushstroke mapping.

## 🕺 03. Sensor-based Interaction (Azure Kinect)  
Investigates how sensor-based perception bridges the physical and digital space through motion data, body tracking, and spatial choreography.  
**Keywords:** Azure Kinect · OpenCV · Depth Sensing · Motion Visualization  

### Projects  
- **Silhak Dance** — Interactive performance using body movement as data to generate visual compositions.  
- **To Eternity** — Depth-based choreography exploring continuity between motion, space, and time.  
- **Beads Wall** — Large-scale interactive wall translating body tracking data into dynamic particle visualizations driven by Azure Kinect.

## 🥽 04. Interactive VR Experience  
Immersive prototypes exploring narrative, emotion, and agency in virtual environments.  
**Keywords:** Unity XR Toolkit · Unreal Engine · OpenXR · Presence & Agency  

### Projects  
- **Escape Metro** — Narrative VR journey set in an underground transit space reflecting isolation and psychological escape.  
- **Graffiti Freedom** — Participatory VR environment where users reclaim digital walls through gesture-driven painting.  
- **Narci, Be Narci** — Interactive VR simulation examining narcissism and self-reflection in virtual form.  
- **Fineo, Translated Universe** — Sensory-driven immersive experience centered on empathy and shared perception, reconstructing elemental data into visual harmonics.
