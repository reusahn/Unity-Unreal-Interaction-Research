# Unity-Unreal-Interaction-Research
### by Jonghoon Ahn  

A collection of research-based projects and prototypes exploring  
**humanâ€“machine interaction, immersive visualization, and generative systems**  
through **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.  

These works merge engineering and art â€” experimenting with digital humans, sensor-based systems,  
and interactive XR environments to study how technology mediates empathy, presence, and perception.
