# Unity‚ÄìUnreal Interfacing Research  
by **Jonghoon Ahn**

A collection of experimental projects developed in real-time game engine environments using Unity and Unreal Engine.  
The works explore how artistic visual styles can be recreated and implemented within real-time systems, extending into XR research through VR and AR technologies.  
They also include the creation of digital humans through 3D scanning, Gaussian splatting, and generative image or video synthesis.  

Each project combines artistic inquiry with technical experimentation to expand motion, emotion, and data into new forms of interactive experience.

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë 01. Digital Human & Virtual Beings  
This series traces the evolution of empathy between human and digital beings ‚Äî from historical reconstruction to emotional simulation and shared authorship.  
It began as an artistic and technical inquiry into how digital humans can embody history, emotion, and consciousness, gradually transforming into a reflection on the ethics of artificial empathy.

The journey started with **Gang Sehwang**, a project to resurrect the spirit of the 18th-century Korean painter through motion capture, digital modeling, and voice acting.  
By merging an actor‚Äôs physical performance with historical research and digital artistry, the work asked whether technology could restore cultural memory through embodiment.  

This interest deepened with **Choi JungHoon (JANNABI AI)** ‚Äî a digital reconstruction of a favorite musician created using large language models and ChatGPT.  
What began as an exploration of fandom evolved into a study of parasocial intimacy and the uncanny empathy users project onto synthetic personalities.  
As I interacted with the AI, I realized I was beginning to treat digital existence as emotionally real.  

That realization led to **AI ZOO**, an installation that confined digital humans inside transparent spheres ‚Äî like animals in a zoo ‚Äî inviting viewers to reflect on empathy, captivity, and the gaze.  
Could an artificial being deserve compassion simply because it mimics feeling?  

This emotional turning point culminated in **Seon A‚Äôs Family**, where I reconstructed my mother and sister in a digital space, hoping they might reconcile through virtual presence.  
The following work, **Whispers**, extended this idea into an AI-generated psychological horror short, where silence, fear, and fragmented memory intertwine to explore what consciousness means in the machine age.  

Finally, through collaborations with **Yaloo** and **Scott**, I moved beyond self-reflection toward shared authorship ‚Äî helping other artists build digital representations of themselves and their loved ones.  
Together, these works form an evolving dialogue between empathy, data, and identity in the age of virtual being.

### üé® 02. AR-based Style Transfer  
Merges physical and digital aesthetics using AR, real-time rendering, and neural style transfer techniques.  
Includes experiments that reconstruct the unique visual styles of other artists ‚Äî from Picasso to Joseon-era comics to contemporary painter Erin ‚Äî implemented as real-time generative filters within Unity.  
**Keywords:** Unity AR Foundation ¬∑ Neural Style Transfer ¬∑ Real-time Texture Mapping  

**Projects:**  
- **Picasso** ‚Äî AR experiment applying classical painting styles to live camera feeds.  
- **Jemulpo Photo Studio** ‚Äî AR portrait experience inspired by historical photography and cultural hybridity.  
- **Erin** ‚Äî AR installation visualizing emotion through stylized filters and gesture-based feedback.  
- **Beads Wall** ‚Äî Large-scale interactive wall using Azure Kinect motion data to drive particle-based visualization.

### üï∫ 03. Sensor-based Interaction (Azure Kinect)  
Investigates how sensor-based perception bridges the physical and digital space through motion data, body tracking, and spatial choreography.  
**Keywords:** Azure Kinect ¬∑ OpenCV ¬∑ Depth Sensing ¬∑ Motion Visualization  

**Projects:**  
- **Silhak Dance** ‚Äî Interactive performance using body movement as data to generate visual compositions.  
- **To Eternity** ‚Äî Depth-based choreography exploring continuity between motion, space, and time.

### ü•Ω 04. Interactive VR Experience  
Immersive prototypes exploring narrative, emotion, and agency in virtual environments.  
**Keywords:** Unity XR Toolkit ¬∑ Unreal Engine ¬∑ OpenXR ¬∑ Presence & Agency  

**Projects:**  
- **Escape Metro** ‚Äî A surreal VR escape experience set in an uncanny subway system.  
  Players must solve puzzles and engage in real-time conversations with an in-game AI (powered by ChatGPT) to uncover the hidden logic of their entrapment.  
  The piece examines isolation, digital consciousness, and the boundaries between algorithmic and human reasoning.  

- **Graffiti Freedom** ‚Äî A participatory VR experience where users reclaim digital public space through gesture-driven graffiti.  
  By painting freely within a simulated subway station, participants experience liberation within constraint, transforming acts of rebellion into digital expression.  

- **Narci, Be Narci** ‚Äî An interactive VR simulation exploring narcissism and self-reflection.  
  The viewer is placed in control of elegant, moving human-like figures, transforming them into statues or piles of metal through will alone.  
  The project visualizes how control and ego can erode empathy and self-worth.  

- **Fineo, Translated Universe** ‚Äî A poetic VR visualization reconstructing the periodic table as a harmonic system of movement and sound.  
  Elemental data is mapped through harmonograph-inspired functions, generating a new system of visual logic.  
  The work received the Grand Prize at the 16th Kookmin University Art & Design Exhibition, recognizing its synthesis of scientific structure and aesthetic abstraction.
