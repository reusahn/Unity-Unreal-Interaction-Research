# Unity–Unreal Interaction Research  
### by Jonghoon Ahn  

A collection of experimental projects developed in real-time game engine environments using Unity and Unreal Engine.
The works explore how artistic visual styles can be recreated and implemented within real-time systems, extending into XR research through VR and AR technologies.
They also include the creation of digital humans through 3D scanning, Gaussian splatting, and generative image or video synthesis.
