## 🧩 Overview  
**NARCI** and **Be NARCI** form a dual VR installation that explores the psychological and emotional mechanics of **narcissism** through two opposing perspectives —  
the **victim** and the **perpetrator**.  

In **NARCI**, the participant is trapped inside a claustrophobic elevator where they encounter a series of narcissistic figures.  
Through **gaslighting-like dialogue and disorienting reflections**, the viewer’s sense of self gradually erodes, mirroring the emotional manipulation of toxic relationships.  
The journey culminates in a moment of **self-confrontation and restoration**, transforming psychological damage into self-recognition and healing.  

In **Be NARCI**, the roles are reversed — the participant becomes the narcissist.  
With each controlling gesture, they **transform graceful human-like beings into frozen statues or metallic debris**, experiencing the seductive illusion of control.  
By embodying both perspectives, the project reveals how **ego, validation, and empathy** intertwine in cycles of power and loss.

## 🧠 Artistic & Research Focus  
The **NARCI series** investigates how **narcissism functions as both a personal trauma and a social pathology**.  
By immersing participants in conflicting roles—**the manipulated and the manipulator**—the work exposes the emotional architecture of power, control, and dependence.  

Through its duality, the project transforms narcissism from an invisible psychological wound into a **spatial, performative experience**,  
inviting audiences to reflect on empathy, healing, and the act of reclaiming identity in a mediated world.
