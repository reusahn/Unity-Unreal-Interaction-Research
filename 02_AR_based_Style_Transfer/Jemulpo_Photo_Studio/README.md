## 🧩 Overview  
**Jemulpo Photo Studio** is an interactive media installation that transforms visitors’ portraits into stylized magazine covers inspired by the **“New Women” aesthetic** of early Jemulpo (modern-day Incheon) during the colonial period.  
Once captured, the transformed portraits are **automatically framed, displayed, and archived in real time** within the gallery space—creating a living exhibition of reimagined identities and cultural memory.  

By stepping into a virtual photo studio, visitors experience themselves through the lens of a past era, exploring the evolving relationship between **modernization, gender, and visual media** in Korea’s early modern history.

## 🧠 Artistic & Research Focus  
The project explores how **historical aesthetics and digital interfaces** can converge to recreate cultural identity.  
By referencing Jemulpo’s early photo studios and “New Women” imagery, the work reinterprets photography as an act of self-modernization—  
transforming the gallery into both a **historical simulation and a collective archive** of digital selves.
