## 🎬 Overview  
A short paragraph introducing the work — what it is, what it explores, and why it was created.  
Explain the central idea or experience for the audience.  

**Example:**  
This project reimagines the relationship between humans and AI through immersive digital interaction.  
By combining real-time rendering and motion tracking, it explores empathy and perception in hybrid physical–virtual space.

## 🧠 Concept & Research  
Describe the conceptual background and research focus.  
What question does the project ask? What theory or inspiration does it draw from?  
Include relevant keywords such as *human–machine interaction, digital embodiment, immersive visualization,* etc.

**Example:**  
The work examines how artificial life can evoke human emotion when represented through data-driven behavior.  
It combines artistic storytelling with real-time computation to create an affective dialogue between viewer and system.
