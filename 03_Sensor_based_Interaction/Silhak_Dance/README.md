## 🧩 Overview  
**Silhak Dance** is an interactive media installation featuring a digital character of **Kim Yuk**, a leading scholar of the **Silhak (Practical Learning)** movement from the Joseon Dynasty.  
The virtual Kim Yuk mimics the audience’s body movements in real time, transforming historical scholarship into a **playful and educational dance interaction**.  

When the character taps a classical Chinese poem, a **Korean translation instantly appears on the screen**, connecting ancient knowledge with contemporary understanding.  
The work merges **motion-based interaction, historical education, and digital play**, reintroducing the spirit of Silhak through embodied participation.
